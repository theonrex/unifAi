# Unifi Agent's Features

### 1. Task Creator: Automated Your DeFi Tasks

The Task Creator is the core automation engine of Unifi Agent. It allows you to build and execute customized workflows for your decentralized finance (DeFi) activities. Instead of performing repetitive, multi-step actions like rebalancing a portfolio, claiming rewards, or adding liquidity to multiple pools, you can set up an automated sequence. This tool saves you time, minimizes manual effort, and ensures that your strategies are executed flawlessly, even while you are away from your screen.

### 2. Meteora DLMM Strategy

This is not a single strategy, but rather the umbrella term for a suite of advanced liquidity provision models on the Meteora protocol. Meteora's Dynamic Liquidity Market Maker (DLMM) is a system that uses concentrated liquidity "bins." The DLMM strategies provided by Unifi Agent are designed to help you navigate this system, offering a range of approaches to maximize capital efficiency and fee generation based on market conditions.

### 3. Tweets Opportunities Monitor

Staying ahead in the fast-paced crypto market is crucial, and the Tweets Opportunities Monitor gives you a powerful advantage. This tool continuously scans social media platforms, particularly Twitter, to identify emerging trends, viral narratives, and potential "alpha" from key market influencers. It's an essential feature for anyone who wants to be among the first to spot new projects, follow the flow of capital, and capitalize on social-driven market movements.

### 4. UniQ: Power Your Next Move

UniQ is your centralized intelligence hub, offering a clear and concise view of the crypto market's pulse. It provides you with a curated feed of the latest crypto news, cutting through the noise to bring you the most impactful headlines. In addition, it tracks and analyzes the most talked-about DeFi narratives, giving you a deeper understanding of what's driving market sentiment and where capital is flowing.&#x20;

### 5. Meteora 20bin Strategy: Maximizing Capital Efficiency

This is a specific, high-efficiency strategy for the Meteora DLMM. The 20bin Strategy focuses on a narrow, concentrated range of liquidity. By placing your assets within just 20 price "bins," you can maximize your exposure to trading fees as long as the token price remains within that tight range. This is a strategy for LPs who are confident in a token's price stability and want to achieve an extremely high capital efficiency to earn a high amount of trading fees.

### 6. Meteora Tuuxx Strategy: Find the Most Efficient Pools

The Tuuxx Strategy is all about smart capital allocation. It goes beyond a simple LP strategy by helping you identify and participate in the most efficient pools on Meteora. This agent analyzes pool performance, trading volume, and fee generation to guide you toward the best opportunities. It's a strategic tool that ensures your capital is deployed in the pools with the highest potential for returns.

### 7. DLMM 100/2 Strategy: 100-bin DLMM Strategy

This strategy offers a more balanced approach to liquidity provision. By using a 100-bin DLMM strategy, you can provide liquidity across a wider price range, which reduces the risk of your position going out of range and becoming inactive. While it may not offer the same hyper-efficiency as a 20-bin strategy, it provides a more stable and passive way to earn fees, making it ideal for assets with moderate volatility.

### 8. DLMM Artemis Strategy: Advanced DLMM Strategy

The Artemis Strategy is designed for experienced liquidity providers who want to execute more sophisticated DLMM plays. It leverages advanced algorithms to help you set up complex liquidity shapes and react to market movements. This strategy goes beyond basic range setting, providing the tools needed for proactive management and the ability to capitalize on specific, nuanced market conditions.

### 9. DLMM Mikus Strategy: Expert DLMM Strategy

The Mikus Strategy is an expert-level DLMM model for those who have a deep understanding of market dynamics. This strategy is built for high-alpha liquidity provision, often involving a more aggressive and hands-on approach to position management. It is tailored for LPs who are constantly monitoring the market and are prepared to actively adjust their positions to capture maximum returns.

### 10. DLMM Razzaer Strategy: Innovative DLMM Strategy

The Razzaer Strategy represents the cutting edge of DLMM. It incorporates innovative and novel techniques that are still being pioneered in the DeFi space. This strategy is for users who want to experiment with new methods and take advantage of forward-thinking liquidity provision models that push the boundaries of what is possible on the Meteora protocol.

### 11. DLMM molu Strategy: Strategic DLMM Strategy

The molu Strategy provides a highly strategic framework for DLMM liquidity. It focuses on long-term, calculated positions rather than short-term gains. This strategy helps users create positions that are resilient to market volatility and designed to consistently earn fees over an extended period. It's a thoughtful approach for those who prioritize stability and sustained passive income.

### 12. Meteora Agent: Optimize LP Strategies

The Meteora Agent is a dedicated command center for all your Meteora liquidity positions. It offers a comprehensive dashboard where you can easily find trending pools that are currently generating high volume and fees. The agent also provides a single interface to manage my positions, allowing you to monitor your performance, adjust your ranges, and add or remove liquidity with ease.

### 13. Pendle Agent: Maximize Yield Opportunities

The Pendle Agent is your specialized tool for the Pendle protocol. It helps you navigate the platform to find the most lucrative opportunities for yield. The agent highlights high-yield PT (Principal Token) pools, allowing you to lock in fixed returns. It also simplifies the process of claiming rewards, ensuring you can efficiently collect your earnings without hassle, thus maximizing your overall yield.
